        <h2 style="font-family: Georgia;">Why I decided to learn TypeScript</h2>
        <p>
          I’m completely new to coding, and I’ve been trying to understand how everything connects together. 
          When I first started looking at programming languages, I saw TypeScript mentioned almost everywhere — 
          especially in projects that use JavaScript. 
        </p>
        <p>
          What caught my attention is that TypeScript isn’t a totally new language; it’s like an upgrade or safety net for JavaScript.
          People say it helps catch mistakes early and makes your code easier to understand. 
          That sounded perfect for someone like me who’s still learning and tends to make a lot of small errors.
        </p>

      <section>
        <h2 style="font-family: Georgia;">What I knew before starting</h2>
        <p>
          Honestly, not much. I had just a basic idea of what HTML and CSS were — 
          that they made up the structure and style of websites. 
          JavaScript seemed like the “brains” behind everything interactive. 
          TypeScript felt like a way to make that “brain” smarter and more organized.
        </p>

      <section>
        <h2 style="font-family: Georgia;">What I’ve learned so far</h2>
        <p>
          After a few tutorials and experiments, I’ve learned that TypeScript helps by forcing me to be clear about what my code is doing. 
          For example, if I say something is a number, TypeScript won’t let me accidentally treat it like a piece of text later on. 
          It points out problems before I even run the program, which saves me a lot of confusion.
        </p>
        <p>
          I also learned about something called “types” — they’re like labels that describe what kind of data a variable can hold. 
          At first, it felt strict, but then I realized it’s kind of like having a teacher double-check my work before I turn it in.
        </p>

      <section>
        <h2 style="font-family: Georgia;">What makes TypeScript feel beginner-friendly</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>It builds on JavaScript:</strong> I can still use all the JavaScript tutorials I find online.</li>
          <li><strong>Instant feedback:</strong> The errors and warnings actually explain what went wrong.</li>
          <li><strong>Better organization:</strong> I can see what each variable or function is supposed to do.</li>
          <li><strong>Encourages good habits:</strong> I’m learning to write cleaner, more consistent code early on.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2 style="font-family: Georgia;">What I want to learn next</h2>
        <p>
          I still have a long way to go. I want to get more comfortable building small projects using TypeScript —
          maybe something simple like a calculator or a to-do list app. 
          I also want to understand how TypeScript connects with frameworks like React, 
          since a lot of modern web development seems to use them together.
        </p>
        <p>
          For now, I’m just taking it one step at a time, writing tiny bits of code, 
          breaking things, and slowly understanding how it all fits together.
        </p>

      <section>
        <h2 style="font-family: Georgia;">Final thoughts</h2>
        <p>
          Learning TypeScript as a beginner isn’t about mastering it right away — 
          it’s about building confidence and curiosity. 
          I like how it keeps me thinking about what my code really means. 
          Even though I’m still figuring things out, it feels like the start of something exciting.
