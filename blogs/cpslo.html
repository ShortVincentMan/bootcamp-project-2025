        <h2 style="font-family: Georgia;">The beginning of something new</h2>
        <p>
          Starting my first year as a <strong>Computer Engineering student at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo</strong> has been a mix of excitement, confusion, and small victories. 
          I came here knowing I loved building things — from small electronics to weird side projects — 
          but I wasn’t totally sure what being a “computer engineer” really meant in a university setting.
        </p>
        <p>
          The first few weeks hit fast. Suddenly, I was balancing lectures, labs, 
          late-night problem sets, and a completely new environment. 
          But even through the chaos, I’ve started to realize what makes Cal Poly’s <em>Learn by Doing</em> philosophy so special.
        </p>

      <section>
        <h2 style="font-family: Georgia;">Learning by doing</h2>
        <p>
          What stands out about Cal Poly is how quickly they get you hands-on with real work. 
          Even as a freshman, I’m already getting to write code, wire circuits, and build small systems from scratch — 
          sometimes successfully, sometimes not. But that’s kind of the point. 
        </p>
        <p>
          It’s not just about memorizing syntax or formulas; it’s about understanding how things connect, 
          troubleshooting, and thinking critically when things break. 
          My classes have shown me that “engineering” isn’t just technical — it’s creative problem-solving under pressure.
        </p>

      <section>
        <h2 style="font-family: Georgia;">The struggles (and small wins)</h2>
        <p>
          I’ll be honest — it hasn’t been easy. There are nights where the code won’t compile, 
          where math homework feels endless, and where it’s hard not to doubt yourself. 
          But every small win, every working program, every project that finally comes together 
          reminds me why I chose this major in the first place.
        </p>
        <p>
          I’ve learned that struggling is part of the process. 
          Everyone here, no matter how smart they seem, is figuring things out one step at a time. 
          I’ve started to value the late-night debugging sessions, 
          the quiet walks back from the lab, and the feeling of progress — even if it’s slow.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2 style="font-family: Georgia;">Finding community</h2>
        <p>
          One of the best surprises so far has been the people I’ve met. 
          From classmates to lab partners to club members, everyone’s passionate about something. 
          I’ve started getting involved with Hack4Impact — a club that uses code for social good — 
          and it’s shown me how technology can make a real difference when applied to the right problems.
        </p>
        <p>
          It’s motivating to be surrounded by people who love to build, experiment, 
          and share what they’re learning. It reminds me that I’m not doing this alone.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2 style="font-family: Georgia;">Looking ahead</h2>
        <p>
          I don’t have everything figured out — not even close. 
          But that’s okay. I’m learning what kind of engineer I want to become, 
          and I’m building a foundation that’ll help me get there. 
          Every project, every challenge, and every mistake is part of that process.
        </p>
        <p>
          My goal is simple: keep learning, keep creating, and keep improving. 
          Whether it’s through classes, clubs, or personal projects, 
          I want to use what I’m learning to build things that matter — 
          and maybe even inspire someone else who’s just starting out.
        </p>

      <section>
        <h2 style="font-family: Georgia;">Final thoughts</h2>
        <p>
          Being a first-year Computer Engineering student at Cal Poly is a lot of things: challenging, confusing, rewarding, 
          and inspiring all at once. I’ve made mistakes, fixed them, and learned a ton along the way. 
          And honestly, that’s what makes it worth it.
        </p>
        <p>
          If the rest of my time here is anything like this first quarter, 
          I know it’s going to be one wild, fulfilling ride.
